# Urban Data Analysis Project (Crime, Schools & Census)

This project explores urban datasets related to crime rates, school performance, and census demographics using Python, SQL, and data analysis techniques. The goal is to analyze real-world data to understand trends in public safety, education, and population characteristics across neighborhoods.

This notebook project was originally inspired by a guided lab from the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**. However, the structure, code, and explanations in this version have been independently written and formatted for public presentation and portfolio use.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Load and clean real-world datasets
- Integrate data into a relational database (SQLite)
- Use SQL queries to extract meaningful information
- Analyze and visualize trends using Pandas
- Generate insights about neighborhood safety, educational performance, and demographics

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- SQLite (via SQLAlchemy and `ipython-sql`)
- IBM Cloud SQL Sandbox (original environment)
- SQL

---

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used

The analysis is based on three datasets:

1. **Crime Data**  
   - Includes offense types and counts by neighborhood  
   - Useful for identifying high-crime areas

2. **Schools Data**  
   - Covers performance scores, enrollment, and school ratings  
   - Helps assess quality of education by location

3. **Census Data**  
   - Contains population, age distribution, and income metrics  
   - Provides demographic context to support analysis

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Analysis Performed

- Top and bottom neighborhoods by crime rate
- Correlation between school ratings and crime levels
- Demographic breakdown of high-crime vs low-crime areas
- Population size vs school enrollment ratios
- SQL joins and filters to combine datasets meaningfully

---

## ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Wrangling
- SQL Query Writing
- Relational Database Design
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data-Driven Insight Generation

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project provides a practical demonstration of how different types of urban data can be combined and analyzed to reveal patterns and correlations. By integrating datasets across crime, education, and demographics, we gain a broader understanding of how city environments function. This project highlights the importance of data analysis in urban planning, policy-making, and community development.

## ðŸ“Œ Note

This project is for educational and portfolio purposes. Although the original datasets and problem structure were sourced from an IBM training lab, this version reflects original work in terms of analysis, explanation, and formatting.
